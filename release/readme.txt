CyberQueryAI Installer README
=============================

Welcome to CyberQueryAI! This is an Ollama-powered web application designed to assist with cybersecurity tasks. The installer scripts provided in this package will set up the application on your system, including creating a virtual environment, installing dependencies, and configuring necessary files.

URL: https://github.com/javidahmed64592/cyber-query-ai

There are two installer scripts included:
- `install_cyber_query_ai.sh` for Linux and macOS systems
- `install_cyber_query_ai.bat` for Windows systems

Please run the appropriate script for your operating system. Below is a detailed step-by-step breakdown of what each script does.

Prerequisites
-------------
- Python 3.12 or higher must be installed on your system.
- The `uv` package manager must be available (it will be used for virtual environment and package management).
- For Linux/macOS: Bash shell and standard Unix tools (e.g., tput, chmod).
- For Windows: Command Prompt (cmd.exe) and Windows batch scripting support.
- Sufficient disk space for the virtual environment and application files.
- Administrative privileges may be required for service creation on Linux/macOS.

Which Script to Run?
--------------------
- If you are on Linux or macOS, run `./install_cyber_query_ai.sh`
- If you are on Windows, run `install_cyber_query_ai.bat` (double-click or run from Command Prompt)

Step-by-Step Breakdown: Linux/macOS Installer (install_cyber_query_ai.sh)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Setup Variables and Directories**:
   - Defines package name, virtual environment name, executable names, and file paths.
   - Creates a `service` directory for service-related scripts.

2. **Create Virtual Environment**:
   - Uses `uv venv` to create a new Python virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.
   - This isolates the application's dependencies from your system Python.

3. **Install from Wheel**:
   - Finds the CyberQueryAI wheel file (`.whl`) in the current directory.
   - Installs the package using `uv pip install`.
   - Removes the wheel file after installation to clean up.

4. **Extract Application Files**:
   - Locates the site-packages directory within the virtual environment.
   - Moves configuration and documentation files (`config.json`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`) from the installed package to the root installation directory.
   - This makes these files easily accessible for configuration and reference.

5. **Create API Executable**:
   - Generates a bash script named `cyber-query-ai` that sets the `CYBER_QUERY_AI_ROOT_DIR` environment variable and runs the main application.
   - Makes the script executable with `chmod +x`.

6. **Create Systemd Service**:
   - Creates a systemd service file (`cyber_query_ai.service`) in the `service` directory.
   - Configures the service to run the application as a background service, with automatic restarts on failure.
   - Sets up logging to `cyber_query_ai.log`.

7. **Create Service Management Scripts**:
   - `start_service.sh`: Copies the service file to `/etc/systemd/system`, enables and starts the service.
   - `stop_service.sh`: Stops the service and optionally disables/removes it.
   - Makes both scripts executable.

8. **Create Uninstall Script**:
   - Generates `uninstall_cyber_query_ai.sh` which removes all files in the current directory.
   - Makes the script executable.

9. **Cleanup**:
   - Removes the installer scripts (`install_cyber_query_ai.sh` and `install_cyber_query_ai.bat`) and the original `README.txt` file.

10. **Display Success Message**:
   - Prints instructions on how to run the application, configure it, manage the service, view logs, and uninstall.

Step-by-Step Breakdown: Windows Installer (install_cyber_query_ai.bat)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Setup Variables**:
   - Defines package name, virtual environment name, executable names, and file paths.
   - Sets paths for the script directory, virtual environment, and binary directory.

2. **Create Virtual Environment**:
   - Uses `uv venv` to create a new Python virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.
   - This isolates the application's dependencies from your system Python.

3. **Install from Wheel**:
   - Finds the CyberQueryAI wheel file (`.whl`) in the current directory.
   - Installs the package using `uv pip install`.
   - Deletes the wheel file after installation to clean up.

4. **Extract Application Files**:
   - Locates the site-packages directory within the virtual environment.
   - Moves configuration and documentation files (`config.json`, `README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`) from the installed package to the root installation directory.
   - This makes these files easily accessible for configuration and reference.

5. **Create Executable Launcher**:
   - Generates a batch script named `cyber-query-ai.bat` that:
     - Sets the `CYBER_QUERY_AI_ROOT_DIR` environment variable.
     - Starts Ollama server in the background.
     - Runs the main CyberQueryAI application.
     - Stops the Ollama server after the application exits.
   - This launcher ensures Ollama is running when the application starts.

6. **Display Success Message**:
   - Prints instructions on how to run the application, configure it, view logs, and uninstall.

7. **Cleanup**:
   - Deletes the installer scripts (`install_cyber_query_ai.bat` and `install_cyber_query_ai.sh`) and the original `README.txt` file.

Post-Installation Instructions
------------------------------
- **Running the Application**:
  - Linux/macOS: Run `./cyber-query-ai` from the installation directory.
  - Windows: Run `cyber-query-ai.bat` from the installation directory.

- **Configuration**:
  - Edit `config.json` to customize the application's settings.

- **Service Management (Linux/macOS only)**:
  - To start as a system service: Run `./service/start_service.sh` (requires sudo).
  - To stop the service: Run `./service/stop_service.sh` (requires sudo).

- **Viewing Logs**:
  - Linux/macOS: Check `cyber_query_ai.log` or use `journalctl -u cyber_query_ai.service`.
  - Windows: Check `cyber_query_ai.log` in the installation directory.

- **Uninstallation**:
  - Linux/macOS: Run `./uninstall_cyber_query_ai.sh` to remove all files.
  - Windows: Simply delete the entire installation directory.

Important Notes
---------------
- The installer creates a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your system Python.
- On Linux/macOS, the service runs under your current user account.
- The application requires Ollama to be installed and configured separately (the Windows installer starts Ollama automatically).
- If you encounter permission issues, run the installer with appropriate privileges (e.g., sudo on Linux/macOS).
- The installer modifies your system by creating service files (Linux/macOS) or starting background processes (Windows).
- Review the generated scripts and configuration files before running them in production.
