NAME
       recon-ng - Web Reconnaissance framework

SYNOPSIS
       recon-ng [-h] [-w workspace] [-r filename] [--no-version] [--no-analytics] [--no-marketplace] [--stealth] [--version] [--analytics]

DESCRIPTION
       Recon-ng  is  a  full-featured reconnaissance framework designed with the goal of providing a powerful environment to conduct open source web-
       based reconnaissance quickly and thoroughly.

       Recon-ng has a look and feel similar to the Metasploit Framework, reducing the learning curve for leveraging the  framework.  However,  it  is
       quite  different. Recon-ng is not intended to compete with existing frameworks, as it is designed exclusively for web-based open source recon‚Äê
       naissance. If you want to exploit, use the Metasploit Framework. If you want to social engineer, use the Social-Engineer Toolkit.

       See the [Usage Guide](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng/wiki) for more information.
